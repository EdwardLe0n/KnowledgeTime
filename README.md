# KnowledgeTime: A random repo with scripts and tutorials for Unity

## Intro: Why?

There are a couple of reasons, but the main one is frankly that it's hella hard to get into game development. 

On a day-to-day basis, I work w/ a variety of people ranging from fellow Computer Science majors at various levels, as well as folks from different majors. So, this repo is meant to give people an in into game dev and offer some form of guidance!

## How can I use this repository?

### Look around!!!

As a user, y'all can skim through the repository, and find the different READMEs I've scattered around to offer a bit of a tutorial about how I've went around implementing the system. Adding onto this, some READMEs may have links to other READMEs and even videos, so I'd recommend checking them out when you see them.

### If you have any requests...

Feel free to create any issue under the issue tab [which can be found here!](https://github.com/EdwardLe0n/KnowledgeTime/issues)

Additionally, if you'd like to see how to make an issue [then go here!!!](Documentation/MakeAnIssue.md)

### Is code from this repo free to use?

YES!!! Use it please!!!! The entire point is for people to use or reference my dev stories and struggles to save time on development on your end.

My only request is that if you use this repo, or see any videos made by me is that you just say thanks and list me in the credits of whatever project y'all make. I love the engagement, and seeing that all this is useful to someone else :3 

## What to look out for in the future

### For now...

I'll be focusing on:

- Making some basic tutorials based on code I've already made whether they be READMEs or videos
- Making this repository cleaner and more readable!!! i.e. adding images

Again, the goal is to give a good breadth of what I've already made into more public knowledge

However, if you're looking for any help now, make an issue!

### In the farther future...

I plan to make code on tutorials based on code I haven't made yet, or stuff I'm unsure about, so it'll be a lil' learning journey for all of us!

## As a closer...

Just to reiterate some points:

- This code is free to use and copy
- I keep an eye out on the issues tab, so if you need/want something, say something!
- Send over feedback! I love to hear feedback and how this sort of thing can be improved/changed!

With that being said...
# Thanks for your time!!!
